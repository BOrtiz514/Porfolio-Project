# Porfolio-Project

For my portfolio, I decided that the design would be very simple, so that it does not stray from the goal of keeping it professional.
The page has very obvious indicators to help with accessibility. The indicators have features implemented in order to make it even more visible once the user is hovering over it. The color choices make the text very legible, and the design very visible. 


## Homepage

I designed the homepage allowing only a small amount of information to be shown. I chose to put a very large picture of me on a mountain infront of a beautiful landscape. I chose this picture because depending on the person, one can find this to be wholesome, peaceful, and calming. This can better a user's impression of me, as those sentiments may be translated to my image. To the side of it, I very simply list my name, the course I'm in, as well as some of the skills acquired. This is really cut-to-the-chase, as intended. On the top right, buttons can be seen for redirecting. I added hover effects to make my page more engaging, and add a level of surprise to a simple looking homepage. 


## AboutMe

I chose to go with a background image with this page only, simply because I figured since this page is "about me", I could loosen up on the simplicity and professional look. I did not want to just put a background image of a random reptile however. These are Rhino Iguanas which are one of my favourite reptiles. I wanted to make sure that it was the first focus of this page, and luckily the eye of the iguana in focus lines up pretty closely to the Rule of Thirds. Then I listed the About me title along with the description. I used box shadow outside and inside of the borders, so that the inside of the borders could be pretty transparent while keeping the text legible. 

## Projects

For this page i decided to add just 2 projects for now, until of course the course ends. I designed the images so that they would look somewhat like a screen on a tv (but old school tvs, the big boxes). I'm not sure if i hit the mark but i can sometimes see it and I was pretty satisfied with this. I added the same hover effect as the nav bar buttons because i genuinely liked how engaging it makes the page feel. Upon clicking on an image, a modal pops up focusing on the selected image and showing the title + a description on the project. I added an overlay to give full focus to the selected project.

## ContactMe

This page is pretty straightforward, just a contact me form that I made to be very clean looking. The color scheme works well to show a subtle contrast between the background and the form. The form obviously does not work but I made sure to reference my email at the bottom of the form container.
